        <h2>Why Minnesota Quality Care</h2>
        <p>
          We know there are many Minnesota PCA agencies you can choose from.
          Minnesota Quality Care is an experienced home care agency you can
          trust to care for your family. Our company is known for its reliable
          care and willingness to tackle the most complicated cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have served as a home care agency in Minneapolis & St. Paul since
          2000. In that time we have faithfully served thousands of families.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to seniors, we support individuals and families with
          disabilities and chronic illnesses. We can also help as needed for
          recovery care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Minnesota Quality Care provides a caring environment for participants
          that supports the whole person — mind, heart, and body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, when you have a question or concern, you can simply
          call our office and know that our support workers will make sure you
          find solutions.

        <h3>PCA HOME CARE</h3>
        <p>
          Personal Care Assistants (PCAs) are provided by Minnesota Quality Care
          for seniors in need. PCAs help with the activities of daily living
          that keep your loved one safe in their home. They assist clients with
          eating, bathing, walking from room to room, and running errands. PCA
          workers keep clients safe in their homes by being there to help with
          daily tasks.

          your health care team. Our office staff has decades of experience
          working with county and health plan staff. We provide custom training

        <h2>Meeting Emotional Needs</h2>
        <p>
          An elderly or disabled person needs to feel safe and remain close to
          other people. Without sufficient support, patients may have difficulty
          sleeping, poor appetite, or an inability to concentrate. Personal care
          by Minnesota Quality Care will be designed to address the
          vulnerability, loneliness, boredom, and isolation often felt by
          elderly or disabled people.
